I&rsquo;m a software engineer and CEO of Vercel. I&rsquo;m originally
from Lan√∫s, Buenos Aires, Argentina. I owe much of my career to the Web
and Open Source.

I spent my early teens advocating for and teaching people how to use
Linux and later developed a passion for JavaScript and Web development.

After joining the [MooTools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools)
core team, I got my first full-time job as a frontend engineer at 18
years old and relocated to San Francisco, CA.

I started my first company Cloudup in SF which was [later acquired by Automattic](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/automattic-acquires-file-sharing-service-cloudup-to-build-faster-media-library-and-enable-co-editing/),
the company behind WordPress, to power their editing and site building
technology.

After being involved in creating numerous influential open source
projects like [Socket.IO](https://socket.io) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com),
I saw the opportunity in creating tooling and cloud infrastructure to
make the Web faster, with a focus on developer experience (DX).

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) were born. Our platform now helps power the online presence of companies
like Washington Post, Porsche, Under Armour and Nintendo.

## Technical contributions

- I contributed to [MooTools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools) as part of their core team and led the development of the MooTools Forge package repository.
- Authored one of the first books on Node.js ([&ldquo;Smashing Node.js: JavaScript Everywhere&rdquo;](https://www.amazon.com/Smashing-Node-js-JavaScript-Guillermo-Rauch/dp/1119962595)), after identifying the potential for JS to run on both server and client.
- My previous startup [LearnBoost](https://learnboost.com/) was one of the earliest adopters of Node.js in production. We made critical contributions to projects in the ecosystem like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect), [Jade](https://github.com/dscape/jade), [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/), and many others.
- Authored [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), which remains the most popular way of accessing MongoDB data in the JavaScript ecosystem.
- Authored [Socket.IO](https://socket.io), a popular library for real-time communication. Its underlying [engine](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io) powers Notion&rsquo;s realtime sync and the first Coinbase trading product.
- Authored [Hyper](https://github.com/vercel/hyper), a cross-platform Terminal emulator built on Web technologies with over 42,000 daily active developers.
- Designed and co-authored [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), the most popular React framework. I later introduced it at the [ViennaJS meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxFfUs6sYnw) and [React Conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evaMpdSiZKk).
- I collaborated with [Shu Ding](https://shud.in/) on the design and conception of [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/).
- Built a popular file-sharing platform called [Cloudup](https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/21/cloudup-is-a-fast-dead-simple-way-to-share-and-view-files-on-any-platform-without-the-folders/), building on [realtime infrastructure for MongoDB](https://github.com/Automattic/mydb) I authored inspired by Firebase and a proprietary predecessor to Electron for cross-platform Web-based desktop apps.
- Conceived and co-authored a turn-based, multi-player virtual machine running a copy of Windows XP [that went viral](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/windows-xp-virtual-machine/), inspired by [Twitch plays Pokemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon).
- Authored several other popular, smaller utilities that have accumulated billions of downloads, like [ms](https://github.com/vercel/ms), [wifi-password](https://github.com/rauchg/wifi-password), [spot](https://github.com/rauchg/spot) and [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin).
