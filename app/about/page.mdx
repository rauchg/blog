I&rsquo;m a software engineer and the CEO of [Busha](https://busha.co), where we&rsquo;re building a single money app for Africa.

Before Busha, I was an early employee at [Jumia](https://jumia.com) (then Kasuwa). I later ran a software agency that built products for major Nigerian banks, including UBA and Fidelity Bank, and served as CTO at Surebids, where we built Suregifts and Sureremit.

Earlier in my career, I built and exited two startups: [Formplus](https://formpl.us), a global form-building and data-collection tool, and Kraks, one of Nigeria&rsquo;s largest social and digital-media platforms.
