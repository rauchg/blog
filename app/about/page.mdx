# About

Hey! I&rsquo;m **Armin**, a curious '80s child, a passionate explorer of technology, fashion, and ethical practices, and a product leader with more than two decades of uniquely layered expertise in the Travel Technology and Product Management realms.

Growing up, I nurtured an inherent curiosity towards the unseen workings of the world. I immersed myself in the exploration of electronics and painting, forming an early intersection between technical understanding and creative expression.

In those early years of curiosity, I wrote my first line of code, marking the start of my technological journey. I then found myself in the fast-paced world of aviation as an airline ticketing specialist, where I unraveled the complexities of fare calculations and intricate travel routes.

Following a stint as an entrepreneur where I co-founded a travel tech startup, I made a significant move – relocating from Tehran to Toronto. This transition wasn't simply geographic; it signified a shift towards abundant opportunities and a reshaping of my vision and experiences.

Reaching a significant point in my life, I aligned my lifestyle with my deep-rooted respect for all living beings by adopting a plant-based diet. This shift towards ethical living profoundly influenced my professional journey, leading to the creation of my [Eponymous Studio ↗ ](https://arminbabaeistudio.com).

A distinct trip to Japan left a lasting impact on me, instilling a deep appreciation for street fashion and the ingenious work of Kiro Hirata, the visionary behind [Kapital ↗ ](https://www.kapital.jp/). This experience further shaped my studio's ethos, a space where the crossroads of technology, fashion, and ethical practices converge.

As I continue this ever-evolving journey, I extend an invitation for you to join me. Together, we can navigate realms of design, development, and delivery—seamlessly blending software and garment spheres. This venture promises a rollercoaster of learning, an opportunity to challenge norms, and enact meaningful changes.
