# About

I'm a product leader and AI experience builder based in Toronto, Canada.

I specialize in transforming complex technical capabilities into intuitive user experiences that drive real business impact. My career spans product management, AI systems development, and building digital products at scale.

Previously, I led product initiatives at Cineplex, where I grew digital revenue from $2M to $11M, and developed AI-powered systems that improved customer engagement and operational efficiency.

I'm passionate about the intersection of product thinking and emerging technology—particularly how AI can be integrated thoughtfully into products to solve real user problems.

Currently focused on building products that leverage AI to create better user experiences while maintaining the human element that makes technology meaningful.
