In 2018, Cineplex Store was generating $2M annually from digital movie and TV sales. Three years later: $11M. Here's how we did it.

## The Starting Point

When I joined as Senior Product Manager, the Cineplex Store had solid fundamentals but untapped potential:
- Strong brand recognition in Canada
- Existing library of digital content
- Limited platform availability (mainly web)
- Minimal user engagement after purchase

The opportunity? **Make it easier for customers to buy and watch content wherever they are.**

## The Strategy: Three Pillars

### 1. Platform Expansion (Go Where Customers Are)

**The Problem:**
Customers couldn't watch purchased content on their TV, the primary viewing device for most households.

**The Solution:**
Launch native apps on major streaming platforms:
- **Roku** (launched Q2 2019)
- **Apple TV**
- **Android TV**
- **Smart TVs** (Samsung, LG)

**The Impact:**
- **96% year-over-year revenue increase** with Roku app launch
- **140% increase in monthly active users**
- Viewing sessions jumped from 2-3 per month to 6-8 per month

**Key Insight:** Platform availability directly correlated with purchase frequency. Customers who could watch on TV bought 3x more content than web-only users.

### 2. Personalization & Discovery

**The Problem:**
The store felt like a catalog, not a curated experience. Users couldn't find content they'd actually want to watch.

**The Solution:**
- Implemented **recommendation engine** based on viewing history
- Added **"Because you watched..."** rows
- Created **genre-specific discovery** feeds
- Built **wishlist and notification** system for price drops

**The Data:**
```
Before Personalization:
- Average session length: 3.2 minutes
- Browse-to-purchase rate: 2.8%

After Personalization:
- Average session length: 7.4 minutes
- Browse-to-purchase rate: 6.1%
- +117% improvement in conversion
```

**Key Insight:** Users don't know what they want until you show them. Personalization isn't just nice to have—it's revenue critical.

### 3. Post-Purchase Engagement

**The Problem:**
After customers purchased content, they rarely returned. We had zero post-purchase engagement.

**The Solution:**
- **Email campaigns** for new releases in favorite genres
- **Library management** features (organize, favorite, watchlist)
- **Family sharing** (up to 5 devices)
- **Seamless cross-platform** sync

**The Impact:**
- **Repeat purchase rate** increased from 18% to 34%
- **Customer lifetime value** grew 2.2x
- **Churn rate** decreased by 22%

**Key Insight:** The purchase isn't the end of the relationship—it's the beginning. Post-purchase engagement drives repeat revenue.

## The Execution Framework

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)
- ✅ Fix critical UX issues
- ✅ Instrument analytics properly
- ✅ Establish baseline metrics
- ✅ Build cross-functional team alignment

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 7-18)
- ✅ Launch Roku app
- ✅ Launch Apple TV app
- ✅ Implement recommendation engine
- ✅ Optimize purchase funnel

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 19-36)
- ✅ A/B test pricing strategies
- ✅ Refine personalization algorithms
- ✅ Launch family sharing
- ✅ Expand to Smart TV platforms

## The Numbers

**Revenue Growth:**
- Year 1: $2M → $4.5M (+125%)
- Year 2: $4.5M → $8M (+78%)
- Year 3: $8M → $11M (+37%)
- **Total: 450% growth over 3 years**

**User Engagement:**
- **140% increase** in monthly active users
- **3x more** purchase frequency per user
- **2.2x increase** in customer lifetime value
- **22% reduction** in churn

**Platform Performance:**
- Roku: 35% of total revenue by Year 2
- Mobile apps: 28% of revenue
- Web: 37% of revenue
- TV apps generated 63% of revenue combined

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Platform Availability = Revenue Multiplier
Every new platform wasn't just adding users—it was changing behavior. TV platform users bought more, watched more, and stayed longer.

### 2. Data Beats Intuition
We thought pricing was the main barrier. Data showed it was discovery. Users couldn't find content they wanted at any price.

### 3. Small Teams, Big Impact
We did this with a team of 7:
- 1 Product Manager (me)
- 3 Engineers
- 1 Designer
- 1 Data Analyst
- 1 QA

Focus and ruthless prioritization mattered more than team size.

### 4. Launch Fast, Iterate Faster
The Roku app launched with minimal features. We shipped in 8 weeks instead of waiting 6 months for the "perfect" product. Then we iterated based on real usage data.

### 5. Partner with Your Data Team
Our data analyst was embedded in the product team, not siloed. This made data-driven decisions the default, not an afterthought.

## What Would I Do Differently?

**1. Earlier Investment in Personalization**
We waited until Month 12 to build recommendations. Should have been Month 3. The ROI was massive.

**2. More Aggressive Platform Expansion**
We launched one platform at a time. In retrospect, parallel development would have accelerated growth.

**3. Better Competitive Positioning**
We focused too much on iTunes and Amazon. Should have differentiated more aggressively on Canadian content and bundles.

## The Framework You Can Use

**Step 1: Find Your Constraint**
What's stopping 2x growth? For us, it was platform availability.

**Step 2: Quantify Everything**
"Users want it" isn't enough. "28% of surveyed users abandoned purchase because we don't support Roku" is actionable.

**Step 3: Ship, Measure, Iterate**
Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship fast, learn faster.

**Step 4: Double Down on What Works**
When Roku showed 96% revenue increase, we immediately prioritized other TV platforms.

**Step 5: Build Flywheel Effects**
More platforms → More users → More data → Better personalization → Higher conversion → More revenue → Fund more platforms
