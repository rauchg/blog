When I joined Assurance IQ as Senior Product Manager, one metric stood out: we were losing customers at critical touchpoints in their insurance journey. The cost? Millions in lifetime value.

## The Problem

Our customer care and enrollment platform had solid functionality, but we didn't truly understand *why* customers were churning. We had data, but we lacked insight.

**The situation:**
- High call handling times (averaging 12+ minutes)
- Customer retention declining quarter over quarter
- Support team overwhelmed with the same questions
- $2M+ in potential policyholder LTV at risk

## The Research Framework

I developed a systematic approach to customer research that became our north star:

### 1. Multi-Channel Listening
- **Support Call Analysis**: Analyzed 200+ customer service calls to identify pain patterns
- **User Interviews**: Conducted 50+ one-on-one sessions with policyholders
- **Usability Studies**: Ran moderated sessions to watch real behavior, not reported behavior
- **Survey Data**: Deployed targeted NPS surveys at key journey moments

### 2. Pattern Recognition
The research revealed three critical insights:
1. Customers didn't understand *when* their coverage would start
2. The enrollment confirmation was buried in dense policy language
3. Post-enrollment engagement was essentially non-existent

### 3. Hypothesis-Driven Solutions
We didn't just fix problems—we tested assumptions:
- **H1**: Clearer coverage start date communication will reduce "when am I covered?" calls by 30%
- **H2**: Automated post-enrollment engagement will improve 90-day retention by 15%
- **H3**: Simplified confirmation emails will increase policy activation rates

## The Implementation

We built an MVP for automated post-enrollment engagement:
- Day 1: "Welcome! Here's what happens next"
- Day 7: "Your coverage starts tomorrow"
- Day 30: "How to make the most of your policy"
- Day 60: "Quick health check-in"

**The constraints:** We had to work within regulatory requirements for insurance communications. Every word mattered.

## The Results

After 6 months of implementation:

- **$2M in policyholder LTV savings**: Improved retention reduced acquisition costs
- **20% improvement in customer retention**: More customers staying past the critical 90-day mark
- **12% reduction in call handling times**: Fewer "where is my policy?" questions
- **40% increase in policy activation**: Customers understanding and using their coverage

## The Framework in Action

This same framework worked across multiple products:

**At Cineplex Store:**
- Identified that users couldn't find purchased content
- Result: 140% increase in monthly active users

**At Postmedia:**
- Discovered advertisers didn't understand campaign performance
- Result: Managed $12M+ in high-profile brand campaigns

## Key Lessons

1. **Watch, don't just ask**: What customers say they do differs from what they actually do
2. **Quantify everything**: "Users are confused" becomes "67% of support calls are about coverage start dates"
3. **Test assumptions**: Every solution is a hypothesis until proven
4. **Follow the money**: Connect research insights directly to business metrics

## Your Turn

Want to implement this framework? Start here:

1. **Listen to 20 support calls** (or read 20 support tickets)
2. **Identify the top 3 pain patterns** that appear repeatedly
3. **Quantify the impact** of each pattern on your key metrics
4. **Build an MVP** that addresses the most expensive problem
5. **Measure ruthlessly** and iterate

Customer research isn't just about understanding users—it's about translating insights into measurable business outcomes.
