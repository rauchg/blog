Following our [Series B last December](/2020/next-for-vercel), I'm happy to announce we've raised a [**$102M Series C**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform) from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers,
where all friction and latency are eliminated.

We'll use this investment to:
1. [**Build the SDK for Web**](#next-momentum)
2. [**Lower the barrier of entry**](#realtime)
3. [**Focus on the end-user**](#real)

## 1. Build the SDK for the Web [#next-momentum]

    Next.js continues to grow organically as developers <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentchw/status/1392775589094838277">explain it</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vadim_kravcenko/status/1401937274972037122">recommend it</a> to one another
  </span>}
/>

Unlike other software development platforms, the Web never came with an SDK or Standard Development Kit.

While new browser APIs are constantly being added, the responsibility still falls on the developer to assemble them into an _engine_ for every new project.

The resulting diversity of tools and choices makes the Web the innovative and dynamic
medium that it is, but it can also be a major obstacle, as companies rally 
to reinvent themselves in the digital medium.

React, [now 8 years old](https://reactjs.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html), has proven to be a durable abstraction and [building block](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1068183829737664512?lang=en), a narrative violation of the common wisdom that "frontend frameworks are changed every week."

Next.js builds on this formidable foundation to give developers and companies
a meaningful starting point to build great pages, [open sourcing the lessons](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#conformance) learned from the giants of the Web.

## 2. Lower the barrier of entry [#realtime]

Vercel [has](https://twitter.com/bobfmuller/status/1404795808525004805) [given](https://twitter.com/erikras/status/1382420067485417477) [developers](https://twitter.com/otpfy/status/1380458535356669953) access to global infrastructure to
deploy and scale frontend projects. But significant challenges remain to
frictionless collaboration:

- Setting up and maintaining your developer environment
- Integrating it into Git for continuous integration
- Manually pushing and waiting to share progress with your team

Perhaps the most incredible aspect of the Web is that it's not a read-only medium.
Each Web browser is simultaneously the [consumption and creation mechanism](https://twitter.com/sulco/status/1177559150563344384).

With [Next.js Live](https://nextjs.org/live), we want to build a Web that 
everyone can contribute to. Whether it's to pitch in an idea or an edit,
by an experienced developer or a new designer, from a local editor or the
browser itself.

## 3. Focus on the end-user [#real]

<Tweet id="1350618115969789953" />

A particularly interesting challenge of building a platform and tooling 
company is that you have **two users** (whether it's acknowledged or not):

1. The user of the tool
2. The user of the output of the tool

No matter how many downloads Next.js gets, or how delightful and 
realtime the development experience, a universal truth remains: **[the customer is king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right)**.

Performance for the end-user has been baked in the design of everything
we make. To name some examples:

- Next.js was born out of the insight that React in its initial Single Page Application presentation was putting the rendering burden on the user's device that should have been on the [server](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) instead. 
- [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) prioritized giving you a Real Experience Score calculated by each device, rather than just listing traffic stats or TTFB latencies.
- Pre-rendering at build time or via [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/) is all about [taking the CPU cycles entirely out](/2020/static-hoisting#hoist-to-the-edge) of the page serving equation, removing latency for the end user.

Our primary fitness function is your success for your customers. Not
every visitor might understand fully how every page is built, but if the
experience is delightful and fast, they ought to think it was powered by Vercel.
