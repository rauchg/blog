Vercel was born out of my frustration in 2015 that while the cloud enabled
this seemingly infinite array of possibilities (and compute), the _pixels_
on the web weren't getting significantly better. And neither was the experience
of crafting them.

The cloud promised to remove the burden of maintaining physical data centers
and hardware, but ultimately we inherited much of that burden in digital form.
DevOps, K8s, VPCs, CI/CD, IAM, CDNs, IaC... 

The time you should have spent on the pixels... was spent on the configs. The
jobs you could have devoted to product and customers, were devoted to the setup
of clusters and machines.

Over the past 10 years, we've been fortunate to play a role in reversing this story.
We led with developer experience, starting with frameworks
and tools that, upon deployment, _generated_ the infrastructure. React 
pioneered the concept that the DOM is the _output_ of your state and data.

We set out to make Vercel the _React of the Cloud_, where the hyperscaler
primitives are outputs not to be directly manipulated, or jQueryed. And,
in the process, we made a popular React framework too.

The results: Next.js's seen 500M downloads over the past 12 months, which is
more than in the entire 2016 to 2024 period. Vercel is crossing 1 billion
application deployments. We now power two of the top 20 highest traffic
web properties on the planet, like OpenAI and The Weather Company, while also
serving millions of applications of all sizes, including 1-person
companies making millions in ARR.

But to win the next decade, Vercel must heed the advice of its hyperscaler
predecessor and partner: it's always Day One.

AI is eating the Web, and with it, the Web Services we're used to. There
are three massive trends that are shaking up the web, the cloud, and
software as a whole:

- **[Pages to Agents](#pages-to-agents)**
- **[Problems to Solutions](#problems-to-solutions)**
- **[Closed to Open](#closed-to-open)**

I believe this is a transcendental time for developers and users.
We can either give up the web, proxy all our data and intent through
one closed mega-app, or reinvent it together in the open.

## From pages to agents [#pages-to-agents]

The cloud was conceived as a democratization of Amazon.com. Developers
demanded faster mechanisms to provision infrastructure than clunky
data centers, and wanted to dream up new experiences of their own.

Amazon.com is a set of pages. Very fast, dynamic, personalized pages. Emphasis
on fast... something that, despite the rise of AWS, remained elusive to most and
today underpins a lot of the success of the Vercel business. Customers like
Under Armour, PetSmart, DoorDash, Nintendo, and Porsche partner with us because we
help them work backwards from the customer experience, delivering fast pages
and great product experiences, while we automate the infrastructure away.

One of the key unlocks of this first wave of the web was that page speed correlated
closely with conversion. Google rewards page speed with higher rankings, which
creates a flywheel of more business, more conversion, more organic traffic.

Pages got us here, but agents will get us there.

When you Google something and you get 10 blue links, wouldn't it be
great if _"someone"_ opened 10 tabs, did a ton of reading, researched the facts,
compared them, visualized them in a way that's relatable to you, considering
your knowledge, memories, preferences?

Well, that's just the definition of an agent, and something Google is already
doing via AI Overviews, and in the process re-shuffling the traffic makeup
of the internet. An agent is "just" a piece of software that's able to perform
a bunch of steps on our behalf, intelligently, and deliver an outcome.

Unlike pages, agents are not usually synchronous. They're never static. They can think
for seconds, minutes, hours. Soon, days and weeks. Unlike pages, they don't follow
a rigid set of data fetching and rendering instructions. They can write their
own code and create tools on the fly to achieve their goals.

This is making us rethink the services that make up the cloud.

<Table />

Agents get closer to why we invented software to begin with. We wanted to
scale expertise, make users more productive, make people's lives better. I believe
every organization and individual should have the power to create and deploy their
own. Instead of clinging onto the old web, we should pick up its lessons. Everyone
has the freedom to own a domain and deploy to it.

## From problems to solutions [#problems-to-solutions]

To wrestle with the complexity of building and deploying software, we invented an enormous 
ecosystem of tools, frameworks, and services.

Frameworks have so far served two purposes. One, to abstract away the complexity of
the underlying platform, codifying the best practices of expert developers and 
organizations that have gone before us.

On Vercel, frameworks also serve an additional, critical purpose. They automate 
infrastructure through what we call Framework-defined Infrastructure (FdI). CI/CD,
compute clusters, CDNs, caching systems, and more are seamlessly provisioned. Like
a "cloud compiler" that turns your code into optimal infrastructure.

The lifecycle of software is roughly "build and run". Build is the
phase where you write code, test it, and prepare it for production. FdI has given
us autonomy here.

Run is the phase where your code is executed, serving users, processing data,
and performing tasks. This is also where things can go wrong, slow down, or
altogether break.

The latter phase, run, is where we believe AI will allow us to attain the next
level of cloud autonomy. An AI Cloud will be able to monitor, optimize, secure,
and repair itself, without human intervention.

Earlier this year, we introduced our [Firewall Agent](https://vercel.com/changelog/vercel-agent-now-in-limited-beta), capable of responding to
threats and providing high-quality investigations and mitigation strategies
to human operators.
Our [Code Review Agent](https://vercel.com/agent) now analyzes every pull request by executing it in a
secure sandbox and emulating the work of a dedicated, expert colleague
who looks at your code with a healthy amount of skepticism. A (thorough and extensive) _vibe check_ if
you will.

We believe that an agentic cloud will repair and optimize, not merely inform.
Every application at scale today incurs gigantic costs associated with
collecting telemetry and observability data, surfacing it in dashboards...
hoping that humans will open them, prioritize issues, and fix them by hand.

Fundamentally, we believe an AI Cloud shouldn't give you problem after problem
(alerts, 5xx errors, latency spikes, traffic anomalies...). It should give you
solutions: pull requests, recommendations, and automated actions.

## From closed to open [#closed-to-open]

The promise of rethinking all software with AI is thrilling. I believe all
applications and services will involve AI in some way, shape, or form. I
believe the cloud itself will become agentic.

As we reimagine the web and web services, we must ensure they remain open
and decentralized. The beauty of the web is that anyone can own a domain, deploy
to it, and link to anyone else. There's no "app review process", no "platform fee,"
and every protocol and format is open and documented.

The first wave of AI has been dominated by closed models, proprietary SDKs,
protocols, and centralized interfaces.

Instead of a single agentic interface, we should have a web of agents. Instead
of a single model SDK, we should embrace model choice. Our contribution here
is the AI SDK, which not only abstracts over providers, it makes the developer
experience even more delightful than the vendor-specific SDKs.

Developers seem to agree, with the AI SDK package (`ai`) on npm now being
the second-largest AI package by downloads, second only to `openai`:

<Chart />

The early success of MCP as the protocol connecting agents is a promising
foundation of this new web, which won't be made up solely of pages. And
more examples of open AI protocols are emerging, such as for
commerce ([Agentic Commerce Protocol](https://www.agenticcommerce.dev/)) and
coding ([Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/)).

## Conclusion [#conclusion]

The internet of tomorrow will look very different. Users expect (and deserve!) more
intelligent experiences, while increasingly relying on agents to
solve their problems.

This is true for developers, who offload problem-solving to agents. For 
framework and devtools builders, this means our job is no longer to
empower and delight developers, but also their agents.

It's also true for the cloud. The "hello world" experience of yesterday
was a page, today it's an agent. The interface was clicking through UIs,
today it's prompting, or just doing work behind the scenes. [Surfacing
insights and solutions](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1978585286130221336), not endless UI or problems.

For all of us, [developers or not](https://v0.app), this is an opportunity to reinvent and reimagine the web
and continue building it on open foundations.
