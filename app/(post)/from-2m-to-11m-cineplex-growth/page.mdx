How we transformed a struggling digital platform into an **$11M revenue powerhouse** through customer-centric product strategy and data-driven execution at Canada's largest movie theater chain.

## The Situation: A Digital Platform in Crisis

When I joined the **Cineplex Store product team in 2018**, we were facing a critical inflection point. Despite Cineplex being Canada's largest movie theater chain with millions of loyal customers, our digital store was severely underperforming.

### The Numbers Told a Stark Story

- **$2M** Annual Revenue (Stagnant)
- **-5%** Year-over-Year Growth  
- **42%** Cart Abandonment Rate
- **2.1** App Store Rating

### The Core Problems We Discovered

**Poor Onboarding Experience**
- 68% drop-off rate during registration
- 11 steps to complete first purchase
- Confusing value proposition

**Missing Technical Capabilities**  
- No 4K streaming support in 2018
- Limited device compatibility
- Slow load times (2.3s average)

**Trust & Security Issues**
- No multi-factor authentication
- Outdated payment processing
- Low customer confidence scores

**Platform Limitations**
- Web and mobile only
- No living room devices (Roku, Apple TV)
- Poor cross-device experience

## The Strategy: Three Pillars of Transformation

### Pillar 1: Customer Onboarding Redesign

We transformed our onboarding from an **11-step registration with 68% abandonment** to a **3-step progressive onboarding with 24% abandonment**.

Key changes implemented:
- Social login integration (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- Progressive disclosure of features
- Smart defaults and auto-fill capabilities
- Guest checkout option for first-time buyers
- Clear value proposition at each step

### Pillar 2: Technical Infrastructure Upgrade

| Quarter | Initiative | Result |

| **Q2 2019** | Multi-Factor Authentication | +52% trust scores |
| **Q3 2019** | Performance Optimization | 2.3s → 0.8s load time |

### Pillar 3: Data-Driven Product Development

Our weekly rhythm for continuous improvement:
