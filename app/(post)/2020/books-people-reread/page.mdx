Last night I [asked a question](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1289761175253602305) on Twitter: what books have you read more than once?

As it turns out, it turned into a wonderful way of crowdsourcing a compelling reading list from quite a few thoughtful people.

I took the opportunity to [dump the data on Notion](https://rauchg.notion.site/fa0a337c38074aa9b30fdddc6ef4ec2e?v=29294b4b7b0f405f8f5eaf4454c258a2) and write a Next.js page using the new stable [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration) to produce this list and keep it up to date automatically.

Here are all the books, sorted by how frequently they were suggested.
