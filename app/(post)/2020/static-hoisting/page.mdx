Since I published my [2019 in Review](/2020/2019-in-review), detailing the industry trend towards [static hosting](/2020/2019-in-review#static-is-the-new-dynamic) and the rise of Jamstack CDNs like [Vercel](/2020/vercel), a question has persistently come up: [how is this different from a server and a traditional CDN on top](https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1234544556948877312)? Why not then just use servers with containers (even serverless ones)?

The answer boils down to our ability to not just **host** static assets and cache them, but also **hoist** them.

## An Intro to Hoisting [#intro-hoisting]

The word hoisting is used quite frequently in JavaScript to describe how the compiler [extracts and "moves" declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting) to the "top" of a scope, which makes the following code actually work:

```
function a () {
  return b()  // this works with no errors!
  function b() {
    return "hello world"
  }
}
```

<Caption>Calling b() before it was defined works because the declaration was hoisted"</Caption>

The term is also used in [compiler optimization lingo](https://compileroptimizations.com/category/hoisting.htm) to describe a class of optimization where the code is analyzed, and parts that look **"static" or invariant are moved (_hoisted_) outside of loops.**

```
function a (b, c) {
  let sum = []
  for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
    sum[i] = i + /* hoist ↗ */ (b + c) /* hoist ↗ */
  }
}
a(314, 159)
```

Notice that the sum `b + c` has nothing to do with the context of the loop: it's [loop-invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop-invariant_code_motion). An optimizing compiler can recognize it, and hoist it automatically so that the computation behaves _as if you had written it outside of the loop yourself_.

## Hoisting to the Edge [#hoist-to-the-edge]

Hoisting computation within a program is great, and odds are the compilers and VMs you use every day have plenty of optimizations like it.

What Jamstack as a software architecture has now made possible, however, is to **hoisting the results of computation to the edge**, right next to where your visitors are.

A core tenet of Jamstack has been to **pre-render (pre-compute) as much as possible**, which has given prominence to static site generation. The key idea is that computation that would have happened later on, in the request's timeline, has now been shifted to the build phase, performed once and made available for all users to share.

## Edge-aware Frameworks [#edge-frameworks]

Since [Next.js 9](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#automatic-static-optimization), the next build process has started automatically outputting the optimal asset on a per-page

Since [Next.js 9](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#automatic-static-optimization), the next build process has started automatically outputting the optimal asset on a per-page (entrypoint) basis. Futher, with [Next.js 9.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support) the hooks for static-site generation were refined, and [incremental static generation](https://static-tweet.now.sh/) was introduced for [appending](https://static-tweet.now.sh/#incremental-static-generation) and [updating](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-5#stable-incremental-static-regeneration) pages.

Next.js makes hoisting the static parts of your site or app to the edge a breeze. Let's look at the build output of a complex site ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com)) as an example:

```

```

<Caption>The outputs of the Next.js build process vary by the data fetching strategy used by the developer</Caption>

As you can see from the symbols (○ ● λ), which represent the output types:

- We build the homepage statically. Our company's homepage, our "cover letter", gets built as `index.html` and pushed to the edge for maximum speed and reliability.
- The `/api` functions are exported as serverless (lambda) functions. These are created by placing files inside `./pages/api` [(more)](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
- At build time, we create blog posts by querying an API using [Static Site Generation](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support) hooks. Blog posts, like our homepage, are thus statically hoisted (optimized) to the edge network.
- Our [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), despite being super dynamic in nature, is a static HTML page that queries data securely using [React Hooks](https://swr.now.sh) from the client side.

## Conclusion [#conclusion]

CDNs are great and have been around for a long time, and so have static hosts. However, for the longest time, CDNs have been treating the "origin" as an opaque black box.

It's now possible, instead, to push content directly **to the network** and design frameworks that optimize for this capability. As a result, with optimizations like **static asset hoisting**, websites are now becoming faster and more reliable than ever before.
