For most Africans, finance has never lived in one place.

You manage your money across bank apps, mobile wallets, crypto platforms, fintech informal tabs, brokerage apps, and elsewhere. You store wealth in dollars where you can access them, put cash in real estate because you distrust local instruments, hedge risk, and rely on access you may or may not be granted depending on geography, income, or luck. Sometimes, high-net-worth individuals often stitches and out of reach.

Busha began as a trusted, regulated gateway to crypto in Nigeria. Over time, it became clear that our users needed more than just crypto. They needed something simpler and more ambitious: a single money app where Africans can live their entire financial lives, regardless of borders.

**That's what Busha 3.0 is.**

Busha 3.0 allows users to access traditional real-world assets, including stocks and exchange-traded funds, alongside crypto-native assets and emerging instruments such as prediction markets. By using eligible digital assets as collateral, users can access credit transparently and efficiently, within clear risk parameters and regulatory boundaries. This enables individuals and businesses to leverage digital-asset holdings for liquidity, an essential capability that allows an expanded capital market to reach segments of the population traditionally excluded from it.

Our mission is not to replace traditional finance. We will be upgrading access to it.

## From Privilege to Access

One of the most interesting shifts in Busha 3.0 is the introduction of managers and asset-management products we call vaults, built around vetted individuals and strategies.

This is a response to a real-world truth: in Africa, professional money management is deeply informal. Most people know someone who manages money, handles trades, or runs an investment club, but access to structured, transparent, and vetted management was accessible only to HNWIs and institutions. With Busha 3.0, we're introducing vaults, essentially curated portfolios run by verified managers.

With Busha cards, users can spend directly from their balances, whether fiat or crypto. This means instant conversion at the point of sale, backed by real infrastructure and global card networks. No workarounds. No extra steps. And it provides merchants with fiat liquidity without difficulty.

## One App, One Balance Sheet

Busha 3.0 is designed around a simple idea: your money should work together, not live in silos.

Crypto holdings, tokenised securities, fiat balances, cards, loans, stablecoins, managed portfolios, and predictions markets are all unified into one view. There's no context-switching and no juggling separate apps. You manage your financial life from one place, including hedging, without friction or fragmentation.

What makes this vision possible is a platform built not just for transactions, but for long-term financial infrastructure for Africa. Busha 3.0 is a major leap forward for businesses.

## Infrastructure for Businesses, Not Just Individuals

Busha 3.0 is also a major leap forward for businesses.

We are building crypto and stablecoin tooling designed for African enterprises, including secure onboarding and compliance, self-custody and multi-sig options, and seamless integration with traditional financial systems. Whether a business is moving cross-border payments, holding stables for treasury, or exploring on-chain finance strategies, Busha provides the infrastructure.

At the core of the business offering is Busha's tokenisation engine, which enables business owners, asset managers, and creators to issue compliant tokens backed by real-world assets. From real estate to intellectual property, art funds to other asset-backed structures, the engine provides the efficiency and transparency only blockchain can bring, made accessible through a user-friendly interface.

In business accounts, users will also have access to a payment infrastructure layer: robust APIs that allow enterprises to embed crypto and fiat payments directly into their platforms. Whether it's an e-commerce company accepting crypto, an NGO disbursing funds across borders, or a fintech building its own product, Busha becomes the underlying rails.

Busha regulatory is already built on compliance, not as an afterthought. We operate within a licensed crypto framework in Nigeria and are actively expanding compliance efforts across the continent. As tokenised securities, lending products, and payment rails scale, we are pursuing additional licences and regulatory alignments to ensure our users operate within the law, always.

## Where Africans Will Live Their Financial Lives

Busha 3.0 is about bringing traditional and digital finance together, and our new brand makes that explicit. The mark combines the form of a banknote, representing the trust and structure of traditional finance, with a coin, symbolising digital assets and programmable money.

These elements are intentionally brought together into a single, seamless symbol. They reflect how Busha unifies fiat and crypto, stocks and tokens, spending and investing, without forcing users to choose between the old world and the new.

Busha 3.0 is about building the financial home Africans deserve; one that is modern, inclusive, and globally connected. A place where individuals can grow wealth, businesses can operate efficiently, and capital can move intelligently across borders and asset classes.

*Busha is no longer just where Africans buy crypto. It is where Africans will live their entire financial lives. Let's grow together.*
