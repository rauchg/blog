In 2023, I made a $2M mistake at Assurance IQ. Well, almost.

We were about to launch a new automated enrollment flow that our team was convinced would streamline the customer experience. The designs looked beautiful. The logic was sound. Engineering was ready to build.

Then I decided to run "just one more" round of customer research.

**That decision saved us $2M in policyholder lifetime value.**

## The Assumption Trap

Like many product teams, we thought we understood our customers. After all, we had:
- Years of industry experience
- Competitive analysis data
- Internal stakeholder feedback
- Our own "expert" opinions

But here's what we were missing: **actual customer voices**.

The enrollment flow we designed made perfect sense—to us. It consolidated steps, reduced clicks, and looked modern. What could go wrong?

## The Research That Changed Everything

Instead of moving forward, I initiated a comprehensive research program:

### Week 1-2: Discovery Interviews
- **20 customers** interviewed about their insurance shopping journey
- **Key finding:** Trust was the #1 concern, not speed

### Week 3: Usability Testing
- **15 participants** tested our proposed flow
- **Shocking result:** 73% felt "rushed" and "pressured"

### Week 4: Contextual Inquiry
- Watched **8 customers** shop for insurance in their homes
- **Discovery:** People often shopped with spouses—our flow assumed single users

## The $2M Pivot

Based on this research, we completely reimagined our approach:

**What we planned to build:**
- Streamlined 3-step enrollment
- Auto-populated fields
- Immediate policy activation

**What customers actually needed:**
- Transparent comparison tools
- Spouse collaboration features
- "Save and return" functionality
- Trust-building content at each step

The revised approach took **2 weeks longer** to build but resulted in:
- **20% improvement** in customer retention
- **12% reduction** in call center volume
- **$2M saved** in policyholder lifetime value

## The Research Framework I Now Swear By

After this experience, I developed a simple framework that I've used in every product decision since:

### 1. The "5 Before Design" Rule
Talk to at least 5 customers before designing anything new. Not stakeholders. Not power users. Regular customers.

### 2. The Context Map
Understand not just what customers do, but where, when, why, and with whom. Our biggest insights came from understanding context.

### 3. The Assumption Audit
Before any project, list your assumptions explicitly. Then systematically validate or invalidate each one through research.

### 4. The "Show, Don't Tell" Principle
Don't ask customers what they want. Show them prototypes and watch what they do. Actions reveal truths that words often hide.

## Research Methods That Actually Work

Through 500+ customer conversations across different companies, I've found these methods consistently deliver insights:

### Effective Methods:

**1. Diary Studies**
Have customers document their journey over time. We discovered that insurance shopping happens in 3-4 sessions over 2 weeks, not one sitting.

**2. Card Sorting**
Understand how customers mentally organize information. This revealed our navigation made sense to us but not to users.

**3. Jobs-to-be-Done Interviews**
Focus on what customers are trying to accomplish, not what features they want. This shifted our entire product strategy.

### Methods to Avoid:

**1. Focus Groups**
Group dynamics often mask individual truths. One-on-one conversations yield better insights.

**2. Surveys Without Follow-up**
Quantitative data without qualitative context is dangerous. Always ask "why" after "what."

**3. Asking About Future Behavior**
People are terrible at predicting what they'll do. Observe current behavior instead.

## The ROI of Research

Executives often ask me: "Can we afford to do all this research?"

My response: "Can you afford not to?"

Consider the math:
- **2 weeks** of research
- **$15,000** in research costs
- **$2,000,000** in value preserved

That's a **133x return** on research investment.

## Common Research Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

### Pitfall 1: Confirmation Bias
**Problem:** Only hearing what confirms your assumptions  
**Solution:** Have a neutral party conduct interviews when possible

### Pitfall 2: Leading Questions
**Problem:** "Wouldn't it be great if..." questions that bias responses  
**Solution:** Use open-ended questions like "Tell me about a time when..."

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Participants
**Problem:** Talking to power users when building for mainstream customers  
**Solution:** Recruit participants who match your target segment precisely

### Pitfall 4: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem:** Endless research without action  
**Solution:** Set clear research objectives and decision criteria upfront

## Building a Research Culture

The hardest part isn't doing research—it's creating a culture that values it. Here's what worked for us:

### 1. Make Research Visible
- Share video clips in all-hands meetings
- Create customer quote walls
- Invite engineers to observation sessions

### 2. Democratize Research
- Train team members in basic research methods
- Create research templates and guides
- Celebrate insights from unexpected sources

### 3. Link Research to Results
- Track how research insights impact metrics
- Celebrate research-driven wins publicly
- Create "what we learned" retrospectives

## The Mindset Shift

The biggest change wasn't in our process—it was in our mindset. We shifted from:

**"We think..." → "Customers showed us..."**  
**"It should work..." → "Testing revealed..."**  
**"Best practice says..." → "Our users need..."**

This humility has been transformational. Every assumption we've tested has taught us something unexpected.

## Your Turn: Start Small

You don't need a research team or big budget to start. This week, try this:

1. **Pick one assumption** about your product
2. **Talk to 3 customers** about it (30 minutes each)
3. **Share one insight** with your team

I guarantee you'll learn something that surprises you.

## The Bottom Line

That $2M we saved? It wasn't from building something innovative or disruptive. It was from having the discipline to ask customers what they actually needed instead of assuming we knew.

In product management, **humility pays dividends**. And customer research is how we stay humble.
