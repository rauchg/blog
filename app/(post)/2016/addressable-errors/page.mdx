One of the biggest problems with debugging is that error and warning
messages are <b>static</b>. The only way for errors to become more
useful and evolve is for authors to tweak them and launch a new version
of their software.

Unfortunately, some errors are rare and hard to reproduce. You might
stumble upon them in a log-file with little context. Deploying new code
is costly and time-consuming, and the error is not guaranteed to
disappear or become more debuggable.

There’s also a limit to how useful error messages can be by themselves
(although it’s a very good idea to
constantly [improve them](http://elm-lang.org/blog/compiler-errors-for-humans).

The usual way to find out more about an error is to Google it to learn
from others. But even then, user feedback tends to be scattered in many
different places, some of which the project’s authors hardly ever visit.

The solution is simple: <b>attach URLs</b>
<Ref id="1" /> to all your errors and make them collaborative
<Ref id="2" />. GitHub wikis, gists or issues are good candidates for
hosting these. Bonus points: shorten them to make [live debugging](https://i.imgur.com/OANtEbP.jpg) easier.
