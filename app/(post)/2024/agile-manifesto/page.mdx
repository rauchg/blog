In today's business landscape, Agile has become a buzzword that echoes within the walls of corporations globally. Born from a need for greater adaptability and improved customer satisfaction, Agile transformed the software development world before extending to other domains. The Agile methodology's guiding values were popularized by the Agile Manifesto, which was put together during a [weekend meeting](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html) at a ski resort. As a product manager, staying true to these principles can significantly elevate your product's success.

Let's first familiarize ourselves with the four key values of the Agile Manifesto:

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:** 

Agile recognizes that it's the people who build the products, not the processes or the tools. Emphasis is on effective collaboration and open communication.

**Working software over comprehensive documentation:** 

Agile values a functioning product over complete documentation of the system. While keeping records is important, an overemphasis on paperwork should not hinder progress.

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:** 

Agile practices prioritize regular customer feedback over sticking strictly to initial plans. Engaging with customers for continuous feedback leads to a product that truly satisfies user needs.

**Responding to change over following a plan:** 

Agile acknowledges change as an inevitable part of the process. It emphasizes flexibility and adaptability over rigidity in planning.

For a deeper understanding, you can read the original [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) itself.

**Promotes a People-Centric Approach**

By prioritizing individuals and interactions, Agile encourages product managers to build strong, collaborative relationships within their team. An open line of communication unleashes creativity and innovation.

**Ensures Continuous Delivery of Value**

The focus on working software aligns with the product manager's goal to always deliver value to the customer. This approach helps in reducing risks, minimizing time to market, and ensuring continuous improvement.

**Centers the Customer in Decision-Making Processes**

The focus on customer collaboration fosters a culture where customer satisfaction is the primary goal. Regular customer feedback helps shape the product to meet user needs and expectations.

**Bolsters Change Readiness**

Change is intrinsic to product development. The Agile Manifesto embraces this inherent nature by acknowledging change as part of the process. It fosters a mindset in product managers that readily responds to changes in customer needs, market dynamics, and technological advancements with agility.

In the complex, fast-paced world of product management, the Agile Manifesto outlines a mindset that places people, working software, customer collaboration, and change responsiveness at the core of development. Staying true to these values not only helps maintain a user-centric, adaptable approach but also ensures continuous value delivery and high customer satisfaction. Therefore, embracing the Agile principles is more of a necessity than a choice for product managers as they navigate the intricate journey of product development.
