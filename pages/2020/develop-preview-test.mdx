import getTweets from "../../lib/get-tweets";
import Figure, { Image } from "../../components/post/figure";

export async function getStaticProps () {
  const tweets = await getTweets(MDXContent);
  return { props: { tweets } };
}

A few years ago I tweeted a simple guideline that 
[challenged conventional wisdom](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1261202288476971008)
and became the norm for many people learning 
[how to test their frontends](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)
effectively.

Writing tests is an **investment**, and like any other investment, 
it has to be evaluated in terms of its **return** and **risks** (e.g.:
[opportunity costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost)) it incurs in.

The "not too many" keys in on that. There is, after all, too much of a
good thing when it comes to spending time writing tests instead of
features. We can see an application of this insight also to availability
by [Google's popular SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/embracing-risk/):

> You might expect Google to try to build 100% reliable services—ones that
> never fail. It turns out that past a certain point, however, increasing
> reliability is worse for a service (and its users) rather than better!
> Extreme reliability comes at a cost: maximizing stability limits how fast
> new features can be developed and how quickly products can be delivered to
> users, and dramatically increases their cost, which in turn reduces the
> numbers of features a team can afford to offer

In this essay I want to make the case that
**prioritizing end-to-end (E2E) testing** for the critical parts of
your app will reduce risk and give you the best return. Further, I'll show
how you can adopt this methodology in mere minutes.

<h2 id="why">Why end-to-end?</h2>

In addition to integration tests, I want to now make the case that modern
deployment workflows in combination with serverless testing solutions can
now fully revert the conventional testing pyramid:

As it turns out,
[focusing on the customer first](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders)
is the best way to run a business, but also the best way to ascertain
software quality.

You might be using the fanciest new compiler, the newest type system, but
won't do well if, after you ship, your site doesn't load in Chrome at all
because you forgot to send the right HTTP headers for your
`.js` files. Or you use features not compatible with Safari.

Modern cloud software has a great deal of complexity that cannot be
ascertained "in the lab", or by running artificial tests in your computer.
We normally deploy software to dozens of operating systems, mobile
devices, web browsers, networks of varying stability and performance… And
the environment is always changing, as we take more and more dependencies
on hosted services and third-party APIs.

Furthermore, software quality goes beyond correctness. It's not just about
doing "the right thing".
[Quality encapsulates reliability](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/status/1007699924866093056)
(whether your program stays working correctly over time) and
[performance](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/)
(it must do the right thing quickly).

<h2 id="possible">End-to-end made possible</h2>

First, back when I argued for focusing on integration in 2016 and made no
mention of end-to-end tests, we didn't yet have the deployment
infrastructure we have today.

With [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), 
every push to git gets deployed and given an URL. This can be done cost
effectively by focusing on incremental computation, where the underlying
static files and serverless functions used to power a deployment are
mostly re-used from deploy to deploy.

Just like GitHub is capable of keeping the history of your code forever,
so can Vercel. Because deploys are
[stateless](/2020/2019-in-review#static-is-the-new-dynamic),
the resources are only used on-demand and scale infinitely with traffic.

That gets rid of an obvious initial objection: that it would be difficult
or costly to perform end-to-end tests against a live individualized
version of your website. Instead of thinking about a single staging server
that end-to-end tests are run against, now you can have millions of
concurrent "staging" environments.

I say "staging" in quotes because in reality, you run tests against the
real production infrastructure, which has enormous reliability benefits.
Not only are certain
[features these days only enabled when SSL is on](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts),
but having every other production feature enabled, like brotli
compression and HTTP/2, reduces your risk of outages:

/>

Having made staging instant, prod-like and cost-effective, the remaining
objection is that running the actual end-to-end tests would be expensive
or slow, going by the pyramid above.

However, the introduction of
[puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer),
Chrome's headless web browser, combined with serverless compute that can
instantly scale to thousands of concurrent executions (see this
[Stanford paper](https://stanford.edu/~sadjad/gg-paper.pdf)
for an example) are <b>now making E2E both fast and cheap</b>.

<h2 id="easy">End-to-end made easy</h2>

To show the **Develop -> Preview -> Test** workflow in action, I'm
going to demonstrate how easily I can add an E2E test for
[my open-source blog](https://github.com/rauchg/blog)
using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) in combination with
[Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com)
on top of GitHub.

First, I'm going to define an end-to-end test to ascertain that my blog
always contains the string "Guillermo Rauch" in the browser title. As I'm
writing this, it's not the case, so I expect this to fail.

Checkly gives me full access to the Node and puppeteer APIs. Notice I
don't have to write any ceremony, setup or scheduling logic. I'm "inside"
the function that will later be invoked:

    width={1390}
    height={669}
  />
</Figure>

Then, I installed the
[Checkly GitHub app](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/cicd/github/#setting-up-your-github-integration)
and under the CI/CD tab of the check, I linked it to my
`rauchg/blog` repository.

I created a git branch where I introduced the `<title>`
tag for my blog, but on purpose
[I misspelt my name](https://github.com/rauchg/blog/pull/53/commits/b5c30eaef41944f36cf14e7d7f8be9be9953709f).

As soon as I created my pull request, the check was already failing. In
just a few seconds, I pushed, deployed, a headless browser simulating a
visitor ran, and my error was exposed:

    width={1479 / 2}
    height={618 / 2}
  />
</Figure>

This happened with absolutely zero additional configuration. Vercel
supplied a URL, Checkly tested it, GitHub was notified. After pushing
again, the check re-runs automatically:

    width={1018 / 2}
    height={267 / 2}
  />
</Figure>

With my typo fixed, I'm free to merge. Merging to master will deploy my
changes to `rauchg.com` automatically.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

Notably, Checkly allows us to configure multiple locations in the world
that the tests get executed from, as well as
<b>invoking our checks over time</b>.


Leslie Lamport
[famously said](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/distributed-system.txt)
that a distributed system is one where "the failure of a computer you
didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable".

As our systems become more complex, with ever-changing platforms and
dependencies on other cloud systems, continuously testing just like our
users do is our best bet to tame the chaos.
