    </P>
    <P>
      Outside of work, I've now been a part of a number of podcasts or
      conversations with strangers that start with the question: how did you
      learn to code?
    </P>
    <P>
      And now, I'm slightly embarrassed to admit that I've probably given 10
      different answers to the same question.
    </P>
    <P>
      The main reason is that there wasn't a particular instant, or month, or
      year, or flow state I got in where I finally learned to code. It was more
      of a <em>discontinuous</em> process full of ups, downs, impostor syndrome,
      months of voracious learning, followed by{" "}

        months of entertaining distractions
      </a>
      .
    </P>
    <P>
      However, looking back, there were many decisive contributing factors that
      clearly helped: exposure to open-source (Linux), being involved in online
      communities (IRC and forums) and <b>hacking competitions</b>.
    </P>
    <H2 id="izhal">Izhal: the hacker's ladder of success</H2>
    <P>
      One day, on one of the forums I frequented, someone shared an online game
      called "Izhal.com", which I became completely obsessed about. It was
      similar in spirit as another game called "Slyfx.com", which one{" "}
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/www-slyfx-com.659669/#post-2807097"
      >
        could describe
      </a>{" "}
      as a "interactive class on hacking".
    </P>
    <P>
      As I mentioned, the journey towards learning to code didn't have a
      consistent, smooth curve. Looking back, this particular game was one of
      those things I was fortunate to find along the way which seriously sped
      things up.
    </P>
    <P>
      The idea was simple: you start with a simple hacking challenge at Level 1,
      and your goal is to hack the made-up system you are given to progress onto
      the subsequent levels. There was a forum associated with it, where you
      could meet others and get hints. The level you were in was your flair, and
      there was a public leaderboard of everyone who was playing.
    </P>
    <P>
      Izhal's step 1's URL was, if I remember correctly, something like{" "}
      <Code>http://izhal.com/welcome/1.html</Code> and it said "Welcome to the
      tournament". The solution to get to level 2 involved inspecting the source
      of the page and finding a HTML comment like:
    </P>
    <Snippet>{`<!-- The next step is http://izhal.com/secret/2 -->`}</Snippet>
    <P>
      This experience was unlike any code tutorial or book I was consuming at
      the time. It was thrilling, competitive, frustrating, exhilarating. It
      went from easy (viewing the HTML source) to harder (disassembling binaries
      and writing{" "}
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keygen">
        key generators
      </a>

    <P>
      It taught me skills that are essential to problem solving, rather than
      coding itself, like reverse engineering a system and{" "}

      Initially driven by my fascination to understand how the code sandboxing
      mechanism worked, I decided to give it a try. In other words, I wanted to
      understand how the authors of code-golf.io had ensured you couldn't do
      evil things to their system.
    </P>
    <P>
      The first question I had in my mind was: "What is this system executing?".
      Is it invoking a function? Who is invoking it? How?
    </P>
    <P>
      So I decided to throw an error, knowing that the{" "}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace" target="_blank">
        stack trace
      </a>{" "}
      that typically displays with them would tell me more about the
      "breadcrumb" of execution.

    </Figure>

    <P>
      At this point I became even more intrigued. Being familiar with Node.js,
      the stack trace was too short, so Node was ruled out.
    </P>
    <P>
      In addition to ruling out traditional JS execution environments, it gave
      me another clue: the code is being read from <Code>/tmp/code.js</Code>.
    </P>

    <P>
      I wanted to learn more about what was there, so I enumerated the{" "}
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object"
        target="_blank"
      >
        global object
      </a>
      . I wasn't able to get <Code>console.log</Code> to work either, so I
      re-used my previous inspection mechanism: <Code>throw</Code>.

      To my delight: globalThis was defined, which surprisingly indicated a{" "}

      , and the first member I enumerated was called <Code>print</Code>. Eureka!
      That sounds really useful.

      At this point, I suddenly found myself again in 2002. I felt that familiar

    <P>
      I figured: I could define a{" "}
      <b>
        <em>function</em> that prints its own source code
      </b>
      . (In JavaScript, the source of functions is{" "}
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString"
        target="_blank"
      >
        available at runtime for instrospection
      </a>
      .)
    </P>

    <P>
      Unfortunately, it used <b>30</b> characters, but I was encouraged by the
      existence of another path to a solution
      <Ref id="2" />. I fired up{" "}
      <Link href="/2020/2019-in-review#notion-is-fancy">
        <a>Notion</a>
      </Link>{" "}
      and started documenting my attempts.
    </P>

    <P>
      Because I had already tried to compress the code a lot (as you can see, it
      looks quite unintelligible) and the gap between my new approach and the
      old one was a huge 3 characters, and I needed an extra 3 to match primo's{" "}
      <b>24</b>, I abandoned this direction.
    </P>

    <P>
      I went back to my initial approach and I started playing with trying to
      compress the path:
    </P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        Use a relative <Code>code.js</Code>
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Use <Code>/tmp/code</Code> without an extension, similar to how{" "}
        <a
          href="https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_require_id"
          target="_blank"
        >
          <Code>require</Code> works in Node.js
        </a>
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Use <Code>/tmp/code*</Code>
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      None worked. However, at that point I remembered the introspection above
      revealed an interesing <Code>os</Code> object, which I enumerated:

      This looked like the corresponding{" "}

        basic Unix syscalls
      </a>
      , so I gave <Code>chdir</Code> a try, so that I could change the directory
      I was in, and I brought back the relative approach:

    <P>
      Even though I was now at a disheartening <b>39</b> chars, it offered the
      understanding that I was inside a regular Unix-like filesystem. I set out
      to try to understand what was the default working directory of the system.
      Was it{" "}
      <Code>
        <a href="http://www.linfo.org/slash_root.html" target="_blank">
          /root
        </a>
      </Code>
      ? Was it <Code>/</Code>?
    </P>

    <P>
      At that point, I got one step closer: if the default directory is{" "}
      <Code>/</Code>, I can make <Code>tmp</Code> relative!?
    </P>

    <P>
      I got <b>one thrilling character</b> closer to success, by removing that
      despicable leading <Code>/</Code>.
    </P>

    <P>
      At this point I once again "concluded" I had reached the limits of what
      was possible, but I was encouraged by Rom√°n's and primo's success. I was{" "}
      <b>2</b> characters away, where could they possibly come from?
    </P>

    <P>
      My only thought was that the only pair of possible characters that could
      disappear were parentheses, which in mathematics and programming are often
      used redundantly.
    </P>

    <P>
      I pictured removing them, and at that point was reminded of the{" "}

    <P>
      Templates are a relatively new JavaScript feature, I don't actually ever
      remember using it, but I had seen it on Twitter many times due to the
      popularity of its use for CSS-in-JS with{" "}

    <P>
      Throughout that simple game, I had to apply lots of the skills that were
      essential throughout my life as a programmer: figuring out unfamiliar
      environments and systems without a manual, applying multiple "search"
      strategies and selecting the most promising one, iterating and dealing
      with trial-and-error, and perseverance.
    </P>

    <P>
      There have never been as many options to learn to code as there are today.
      From bootcamps, to free youtube videos, to expensive courses and exclusive
      chatrooms.
    </P>

    <P>
      Whether it's with code golfing or hacking tournaments, I suggest giving a
      try to the alternative of learning by having fun, overcoming obstacles and
      a healthy dose of competition with your friends.
