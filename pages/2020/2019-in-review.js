    <P>
      Throughout 2019 we have continued to see the growth of the{" "}
      <em>JAMstack</em>. The idea is quite simple: Any website or app you{" "}
      <a href="https://nextjs.org">build</a> and{" "}
      <a href="https://vercel.com">deploy</a> will use the stack of client-side{" "}
      <i>J</i>
      avaScript, <i>A</i>PIs, and <i>M</i>arkup.
    </P>
    <P>
      By now, client-side JavaScript (like React and Vue) and APIs (like REST
      and GraphQL) are quite mainstream, but my favorite part is the assumption
      that your markup will be <b>static</b>.
    </P>
    <P>First: Why Static?</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        Static is <b>globally fast</b>. When you deploy, we can <em>hoist</em>{" "}
        all your static assets to a global CDN network. By removing the server
        from the equation, we can also maximize availability by reducing and
        even altogether eliminating cache misses.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Static is <b>consistently fast</b>. It gives you "O(1){" "}
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte"
          target="_blank"
        >
          TTFB
        </a>
        ", which is a fancy way of saying you get stable and predictable latency
        to the first byte of the screen. Always, because no code, servers,
        sockets, or databases are involved.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        Static is <b>always online</b>. This should{" "}
        <a
          href="https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1210294503216578560"
          target="_blank"
        >
          not be surprising
        </a>
        , but servers frequently go down and{" "}
        <a
          href="https://kccncna19.sched.com/event/Uads/the-gotchas-of-zero-downtime-traffic-w-kubernetes-leigh-capili-weaveworks"
          target="_blank"
        >
          involve complex rollout schemes
        </a>
        <Ref id="1" />, while static files are trivially cacheable and simple to
        serve. The odds of you getting paged during the holidays because a
        "static asset can't be served from a CDN" are basically zero.
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
      Second: Really, Static? I have <em>dynamic</em> needs.
    </P>
    <P>
      Servers are not going away, but they are <em>moving around and hiding</em>
      .
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>
        <b>Static Site Generation (SSG)</b> can be thought of moving around the
        servers and taking them away from the hot path. Instead of putting a
        server in between the user's request and the response, we compute the
        response ahead of time.
        <br />
        <br />
        This subtle shift pays back handsomely. One, anything that could go
        wrong, goes wrong at build time, maximizing <b>availability</b>. Two, we
        compute once and re-use, minimizing <b>database or API load</b>. Three,
        the resulting static HTML is <b>fast</b>.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        <b>
          Client-side <em>J</em>S and <em>A</em>PIs
        </b>{" "}
        that get executed later, once the static markup and code is downloaded
        and executed, allow for effectively infinite dynamism.
        <br />
        <br />
        Pre-computing all pages is not always possible
        <Ref id="2" />, nor desirable. For example, when dealing with data that
        is <em>not</em> shared between all users and we wouldn't want to cache
        at the edge
        <Ref id="3" />.
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <H2 id="next-the-next-frontier">Next.js, the next frontier</H2>
    <P>
      Next.js has continued to grow in adoption and now powers the likes of

      Thanks to its simplicity, it's a compelling all-in-one solution for the
      full straddle of JAMstack: from a static landing page, to very large
      websites, to fully dynamic applications.

      The "secret sauce" continues to be its simple <Code>pages/</Code> system

      A page is <em>just</em> a React component. The simplest Next.js app is{" "}

    <UL>
      <LI>
        Pages can be defined like this: <Code>pages/r/[subreddit].js</Code>,
        which will allow you to define dynamic path segments with no
        configuration or custom servers.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        If a given page is static and has no{" "}
        <a

        "explode" dynamic path segments into many discrete pages.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        If you create <Code>pages/api/myApi.js</Code>, you are basically

          serverless function
        </a>{" "}

      In short, Next.js is now a comprehensive, hybrid framework, supporting the
      full spectrum of JAMstack with a <em>per-page granularity</em>.

      Furthermore, Next.js has been <em>uncompromising</em> in its commitment to

    <P>
      Many people are quick to write off attempting to write a desktop app or
      mobile app in JavaScript on the basis that it's <em>not native</em>.
      Sometimes the word is used to indicate that JS can't compile down to an
      executable binary that's native to the platform.
    </P>
    <P>
      I propose the following alternative definition of native:{" "}
      <b>
        an app that behaves to the quality standards of the platform it's
        deployed to
      </b>
      .
    </P>
    <P>
      This explains why Electron has been so successful in re-purporsing the web
      stack to the Desktop platform.{" "}

      To achieve platform fidelity, it's obvious one must have access to the
      platform APIs. This makes <b>mobile web "apps"</b> a <em>non-starter</em>{" "}

      On the left hand side, Notion's sidebar puts you in direct contact with
      the graph the documents are organized as. You are free to arrange pages
      into trees and sub-trees of your choosing. On the right hand side, the
      different block types are trivial to create, edit, re-arrange and most
      importantly: <b>combine</b>.
    </P>
    <P>
      In the old world, a table is not thought of as a <em>block</em>, but a
      document that you boot Excel or Google Spreadsheets to visualize. Instead,
      combining headings, paragraphs, tables, databases, lists, etc to your
      liking inside any document, which you link to and open with the same
      realtime collaborative app, strikes me as a revolution whose time has

        At Google, we optimize for the speed at which a team of developers can
        produce a product together
      </b>
      , as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an individual developer
      can write code. The speed of individual development is important, it’s
      just not as important as the velocity of the entire team.

        Servers can be so hard to roll out without downtime that a keynote at
        this year's KubeCon starts with the glaring admission:{" "}
        <b>"Noticing your customers receive 503's every now-and-then?"</b>. By
        not needing to rotate pods, shut down containers, handle signals, wait
        for grace periods, configure and execute liveliness probes… static is
        also <b>faster and safer to roll</b>.

        When the set of pages to pre-compute is too large and would make build
        times prohibitive, it's still probably a good idea to pre-compute your
        most critical public pages, and do the rest <em>asynchronously</em>.
      </Note>

      <Note id="3">
        Crucially, websites and apps that serve the same static markup and code
        to all users have a drastically simpler security model, which means…
        static is also <b>more secure</b>.

        Our infrastructure makes use of CosmosDB, a serverless database by
        Microsoft Azure with remarkably (consistent) low-latency and effectively
        infinite horizontal scalability.

        Perhaps the most fundamental way in which a mobile web app on iOS Safari
        cannot ever be "native" like an app is in the way the viewport size is
        dynamic and shifts as you scroll to reveal different toolbars.
      </Note>

      <Note id="6">
        Speaking of <a href="#native-means-platform-fidelity">native</a>, I
        intuit that, rather than native code generation, native mobile apps owe
        their generally better performance to the a rich standard library of
        well-optimized UI components. Go, when compared to Node.js+npm, has
        similarly demonstrated the success of a great stdlib for common,
        performance-critical needs.
