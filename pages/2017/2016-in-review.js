      What follows is a brief summary of my year organized by different
      categories.

      This classification is certainly arbitrary, but it gives me a model that I

      It aims to make deployment and hosting of applications in the cloud
      simple, instant and global.

    <P>
      Our mission is to empower the individual. At home or inside companies and
      teams. Go directly to production without barriers.

    <P>
      Back in April we{" "}
      <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/why-now" target="_blank">
        announced
      </a>{" "}
      our flagship product:{" "}
      <a href="https://zeit.co/now" target="_blank">
        now
      </a>
      . Once you <a href="https://zeit.co/download">install</a> it, you can
      deploy any project to the cloud with <em>just one command</em>:{" "}
      <b>
        <Code>now</Code>
      </b>
      .
    </P>

    <P>
      We take the <Code>package.json</Code>, <Code>Dockerfile</Code>, or static
      files, build them in the cloud and serve them securely and scalably under
      HTTP/2.
    </P>

    <P>
      Each deployment is <b>immutable</b> and has its own unique URL. They look
      like this: <Code>https://rauchg-blog-hhafwnefgw.now.sh/</Code>. This model
      has a lot of benefits that are not immediately obvious.
    </P>

    <P>
      One is that the same system gives you development, staging and production
      all in one. You can deploy to build, test and iterate during development.
      You can <em>stage</em> by simply sharing these links to your co-workers or
      clients, before you make them live.
    </P>

    <P>
      To go to production, you just <em>alias</em> them. With one command,
      obviously: <Code>now alias rauchg-blog-hhafwnefgw.now.sh rauchg.com</Code>{" "}
      is what I ran for you to be reading these words now. Zero-downtime.

    <H3 id="accessibility">Accessibility is the Mother of Invention</H3>

    <P>
      A completely new perspective on the role of accessibility in technology
      was opened to me by this TED talk by IBM Fellow Chieko Asakawa:
    </P>

    <Figure desc="How New Technology Helps Blind People Explore the World">
      <YouTube videoId="f-mQIWnO3Ag" />
    </Figure>

    <P>Some interesting facts she mentions:</P>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        Braille went digital many years before consumers had digital books on
        their tablets.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        The telephone was invented while building a device for the
        hearing-impaired.
      </LI>
      <LI>Keyboards were developed early on for people with disabilities.</LI>
      <LI>
        The blind community were some of the earliest adopters of internet
        discussion forums.
      </LI>
    </UL>

    <P>
      The argument is very convincing. The demo of the app she's working on
      seems taken straight out of a{" "}
      <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/" target="_blank">
        sci-fi movie
      </a>
      .
    </P>

    <P>No excuses anymore for disregarding accessibility!</P>

      I'm philosophically inclined to think that we should take joy in the
      unknown, in the relativity of it all, in our ability to access{" "}
      <b>nothing but a shadow of the truth</b>, as Terence McKenna puts it:
    </P>

    <Quote>
      It's amazing to me, I mean, if you were to meet a termite who stated that
      his or her goal in life was the perfect modeling of the cosmos. You would
      think it was quite a funny undertaking, and yet how different are we that
      we should presume more than a shadow of the truth?
    </Quote>

    <P>
      <b>True enough</b> is as true as can be gotten.
    </P>

    <Quote by="Rupert Sheldrake">
      The beginning of wisdom, I believe, is our ability to accept an inherent
      messiness in our explanation of what's going on. Nowhere is it written
      that human minds should be able to give a full accounting of creation in
      all dimensions and on all levels.{" "}
      <b>
        Ludwig Wittgenstein had the idea that philosophy should be what he
        called "true enough." I think that's a great idea. True enough is as
        true as can be gotten
      </b>
      . The imagination is chaos. New forms are fetched out of it. The creative
      act is to let down the net of human imagination into the ocean of chaos on
      which we are suspended and then to attempt to bring out of it ideas.

    <H3 id="evolution-hacks-reality">Evolution Hacks Reality</H3>

    <P>
      I came across a fascinating new take on the idea of consciousness and the
      evolutionary origin of perception by means of natural selection by Donald
      Hoffman:
    </P>

    <Figure desc="Do we see reality as it is?">
      <YouTube videoId="oYp5XuGYqqY" />
    </Figure>

    <P>
      The central idea is that our reality is basically a set of{" "}
      <em>evolutionary hacks</em> that confered a fitness advantage to our
      ancestors.
    </P>

    <P>
      An amusing example is given of an Australian Beetle attempts to mate with
      a beer bottle because it satisfied its primitive heuristics. It had to be
      brown, translucent and large. Oops.
    </P>

    <P>
      Notice that I used the word <em>hack</em> to describe these adaptations to
      the environment. I actually took that from the presentation itself.
    </P>

    <P>
      Despite Hoffman's specialty being the cognitive sciences, the explanation
      is peppered with symbols found in the computer science lingo.
    </P>

    <P>
      I find this collision between seemingly disparate worlds to be entirely{" "}
      <em>uncoincidental</em> and just as fascinating.

    <P>
      Confusing perception with reality, he says, is like thinking that the
      reality of a computer is the icons and buttons on the screen, instead of
      the code and machinery behind it.
    </P>

    <P>
      From this lens, even the study of physics, while useful, might not get us
      closer to understanding reality. Inspecting a button on a screen and
      finding pixels doesn't tell us much about how the GPU and CPU work. And
      the same would be true for confirming the existence of the{" "}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson" target="_blank">
        Higgs boson
      </a>
      , with regards to its underlying machinery.
    </P>

    <P>
      What we normally call reality is just the <b>interface to reality</b> that
      evolution has given us.

    <H3 id="">Turing Paper vs Quantum Paper</H3>

    <P>
      A quantum computer is <em>just</em> an endless series of symbols written
      in different universes that interfere with one another. A beautiful
      description by{" "}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch" target="_blank">
        David Deutsch
      </a>
      :
    </P>

    <Quote by="David Deutsch">
      Turing hoped that his abstracted-paper-tape model was so simple, so
      transparent and well defined, that it would not depend on any assumptions
      about physics that could conceivably be falsified, and therefore that it
      could become the basis of an abstract theory of computation that was
      independent of the underlying physics. ‘He thought,’ as Feynman once put
      it, ‘that he understood paper.’ But he was mistaken. Real,
      quantum-mechanical paper is wildly different from the abstract stuff that
      the Turing machine uses. The Turing machine is entirely classical, and
      does not allow for the possibility the paper might have different symbols
      written on it in different universes, and that those might interfere with
      one another
